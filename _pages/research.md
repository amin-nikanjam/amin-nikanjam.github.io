My research follows two lines: 1) leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve problems with a recent focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) for Agentic Systems and code/test generation, and 2) addressing trustworthiness issues in AI-based software systems focusing on Testing Machine Learning (ML) based Systems and their Quality Assurance.

**Software Engineering for AI-based systems**

AI-based systems are developed and then deployed as software systems. So, like any other software, they need engineering: from requirement analysis to testing and maintenance. Moreover, many established techniques in traditional SE should be adapted to AI-based systems due to their data-sensitive and non-deterministic nature.

**Appied AI**

Modern software systems are highly complex and often pose novel challenges in different aspects of SE. On the other hand, AI has been proven to be effective in addressing various SE challenges.
