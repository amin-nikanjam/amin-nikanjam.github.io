Researcher in the SWAT team, I am studying 1) how Software Engineering practices (like testing and fault localization) can be leveraged to Machine Learning-based systems, 2) how Machine Learning techniques can be applied for safety-critical systems in terms of robustness, explainability, and data privacy. My research, in general, is toward development of novel techniques and tools to improve the dependability, certifiability, reproducibility, maintainability and explainability of software systems developed using Artificial Intelligence (like deep learning and deep reinforcement learning). I have empirically studied a wide range of Software Engineering problems, including software release pipeline, bug triaging and prediction, design pattern and anti-patterns.

Before joining Polytechnique Montr√©al, I was an assistant professor at K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Iran. I was working on Search-Based Software Engineering (specified by graph transformation system), and deep reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems. I received my Master's and Ph.D. from Iran University of Science and Technology. I mainly studied evolutionary algorithms, their applications (function approximation with classifier systems) and efficiency enhancement of model learning in estimation of distribution algorithms.

#This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

#A data-driven personal website
#======
#Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
