Researcher at [Huawei Canada](https://www.huawei.com/ca/), I am investigating 1) leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve Software Engineering (SE) problems with a recent focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) for Code-related Tasks, and 2) addressing trustworthiness issues in AI-based software systems focusing on Testing Machine Learning (ML) based Software Systems and their Quality Assurance.

Before joining [Huawei Canada](https://www.huawei.com/ca/), I was a Research Associate at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/). My research, in general, was toward development of novel techniques and tools to improve the dependability, certifiability, reproducibility, maintainability and explainability of software systems developed using AI (like deep learning and deep reinforcement learning). Also, I have empirically studied a wide range of Software Engineering problems, including software release pipeline, bug triaging and prediction, design pattern and anti-patterns. Before Polytechnique Montréal, I worked at [University of Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/) as Invited Researcher, and at [K. N. Toosi University of Technology](https://kntu.ac.ir/page-Index/FA/0) as Assistant Professor. My main research focus was on Search-Based Software Engineering (specified by graph transformation system), and deep reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems. I received my Master's and Ph.D. from [Iran University of Science and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en). During my graduate studies, I mainly investigated evolutionary algorithms, their applications (function approximation with classifier systems) and efficiency enhancement of model learning in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms.
